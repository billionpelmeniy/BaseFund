# BaseFund

A decentralized fundraising platform built on the Base blockchain to allow users to create and participate in fundraising campaigns.

## Features
- Create a fundraiser with a specific goal and deadline.
- Donate to any active fundraiser.
- Track donation progress for each campaign.
- Funds are automatically released to the campaign owner when the goal is reached.

## How It Works

### Smart Contract:
The `Fundraiser.sol` contract allows users to create a fundraiser, accept donations, and withdraw funds once the goal is met.

### Frontend:
The frontend is built with React.js, allowing users to interact with the blockchain and manage donations via a simple UI.
